0. reorganize example scripts

1. HackaMol::PeriodicTable needs to be reengineered 
  - the data should be of higher quality
  - access needs to be fast
  - some datastructures such as KNOWN_NAMES accessible, and such mappings can be mutable.

3. basic pdbqt reading support  ------>  DONE! DMR 04-01-2014
  3a. pull the tree of rotatable bonds groups

4. pdbqt writing support (3 should be easier)

5. refactor test suite

6b. add an attribute that allows a map from names to symbols/Zs to be built
    in reading pdb files etc

7. improve examples; add more
  - one with an extended class meta bizness

8. storage, persistance, and use of MongoDB!

9. remove the QmMolRol attributes from being loaded.  That should be added 
through extensions that actually manage QM.  it seems a bit excessive to 
include even if it they are lazy. HackaMol::X::Vina depends on score
attribute.  keep in mind

10. based on reading PDBQT may be able to simplify/rethink atom rotations about a bond.

12. improve the binning in AtomGroupRole.  there is bin_this and then atom_bin 
stuff etc.

13. improve use of hush_read attribute in MolReadRole.  Currently, only used for the dirty carp in PDB reading.

14. figure out how to get Dist::Zilla to automate version numbers with some sanity
